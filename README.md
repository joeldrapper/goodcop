Good Cop is a configuration for [RuboCop](https://rubocop.org) that’s been known to be a little more lenient and agreeable than other cops. Just add this line to the top of your RuboCop config file to start using it today.

```
inherit_from: "https://www.goodcop.style/rubocop.yml"
```

If RuboCop goes goblin mode on your code, please [open an issue](https://github.com/joeldrapper/good_cop/issues/new) and let us know.
